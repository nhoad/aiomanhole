Change History
==============

 - Added support for Python 3.10. Thank you to Peter BÃ¡bics for contributing this!
 - Removed support for Python 3.5.

0.6.0 (30th April 2019)
 - Don't use the global loop. Thanks Timothy Fitz!
 - Allow a port of 0. Thanks Timothy Fitz!

0.5.0 (6th August 2018)

0.4.2 (3rd March 2017)

   occurs.

0.4.1 (3rd March 2017)
 - Ensure prompts are bytes, broken in 0.4.0.

0.4.0 (3rd March 2017)
 - Ensure actual syntax errors get reported to the client.

0.3.0 (23rd August 2016)
 - **Behaviour change** aiomanhole no longer attempts to remove the UNIX socket
   on shutdown. This was flakey behaviour and does not match best practice
   (i.e. removing the UNIX socket on startup before you start your server). As
   a result, errors creating the manhole will now be logged instead of silently
   failing.
 - `start_manhole` now returns a Future that you can wait on.
 - Giving a loop to `start_manhole` now works more reliably. This won't matter
   for most people.
